          Linze.pro is a platform designed to showcase my portfolio projects and share technical
          articles with a wider audience. As the admin, I can create, edit, and manage blog posts,
          while users can browse the posts, view information about me, and explore my portfolio. The
          blog supports both English and Chinese, allowing users to filter posts by tags.

          The purpose of this project was to build a versatile platform where I could not only
          display my personal and technical achievements but also engage with an audience by sharing
          valuable technical insights. I wanted to create an intuitive, multi-language blog with a
          clean, responsive UI and a robust backend to demonstrate my skills in full-stack
          development, including frontend, backend, and deployment.

          As the sole developer on this project, I designed and implemented both the frontend and
          backend. I utilized Vue.js and Tailwind CSS to create an intuitive and aesthetically
          pleasing user interface. On the backend, I used Golang with the chi framework to build a
          secure, scalable, and efficient API. I also integrated PostgreSQL as the database and took
          care of the server-side logic, including authentication, caching, and performance
          optimization.

          <li>
            Frontend Development: I started by designing a user-friendly frontend with Vue.js and
            Tailwind CSS, ensuring that the UI was responsive and supported both English and
            Chinese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Backend Development: I used Golang and the chi framework for building the RESTful API.
            Key features like JWT authentication, CORS strategies, and rate-limiting middleware were
            integrated for security and scalability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Database Design: PostgreSQL was chosen for its reliability and scalability. I structured
            the database to handle blog posts, tags, user statistics (likes, views), and
            multilingual content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deployment & DevOps: The app is dockerized for easy deployment using Docker and Docker
            Compose. Caddy is used as a reverse proxy and static file server. I set up GitHub
            actions for continuous integration and delivery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testing & Debugging: To ensure the appâ€™s reliability, I implemented unit and integration
            tests, while logging and monitoring were set up to keep track of any issues.
