# 🌐 Linze.pro

**A modern, multilingual blog app built with Vue and Go to showcase my portfolio and share technical articles.**

------

## 📖 Project Overview

**Linze.pro** is a full-stack blog platform where I present my portfolio projects and publish technical articles in both **English** and **Chinese**. The app allows visitors to explore posts by tags, view blog statistics like views and likes, and learn more about me and my work.

As the admin, I can create and manage blog content via a secure backend interface. The platform is designed with a clean, responsive UI and built on a scalable architecture optimized for performance and security.

------

## 🎯 Motivation

I created Linze.pro as a personal platform to:

* **Showcase my portfolio** in a centralized, accessible format
* **Share technical insights** and experiences with a broader audience
* **Practice full-stack development** using modern technologies and real-world requirements
* **Explore multilingual content handling** for better accessibility

This project reflects my commitment to clean code, performance optimization, and elegant user experiences.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I was the **sole designer and developer** of the entire project, responsible for:

* UI/UX design and responsive layout with **Vue.js** and **Tailwind CSS**
* Backend architecture, API design, and implementation using **Golang** and **chi**
* Database modeling and management with **PostgreSQL**
* Security implementations, including **JWT authentication**, **rate limiting**, and **CORS**
* Caching with **Redis** for better performance
* CI/CD setup with **GitHub Actions**
* **Dockerization** and deployment with **Docker Compose** and **Caddy**

## ⚙️ Development Process

1. **Frontend**: Built with Vue.js + Tailwind CSS to create a clean, mobile-friendly UI with multilingual support.
2. **Backend**: Developed a RESTful API using Go and chi, with strict CORS, JWT authentication, and logging.
3. **Database**: Structured PostgreSQL schemas to support blog posts, tags, user stats, and translations.
4. **DevOps**: Containerized the app using Docker and managed deployments via Docker Compose and Caddy.
5. **CI/CD & Testing**: Implemented automated GitHub Actions workflows and wrote unit/integration tests.
